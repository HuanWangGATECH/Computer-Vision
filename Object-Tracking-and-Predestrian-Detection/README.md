# Object Tracking and Pedestrian Detection

This project is aiming to implement tracking methods for image sequences and videos by using the Kalman and Particle Filter algorithms. The main objectives of this project are: identify which image processing methods work best in order to locate an object in a scene, learn how object tracking in images works, explore different methods to build a tracking algorithm that relies on measurements and a prior state, and create methods that can track an object when occlusions are present in the scene.
