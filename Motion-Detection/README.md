# Motion Detection

This project is aiming to use standard method: Hierarchical Lucas and Kanade, for computing a dense flow field where a flow field is a vector field <u(x,y), v(x,y)>. This project will implement methods from simpler operations in order to understand more about array manipulation and the math behind them. The main learning objectives are: Implement the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, learn how pixel movement can be seen as flow vectors, create image resizing functions with interpolation, implement hierarchical Lucas-Kanade algorithm, understand the benefits of using Pyramidal approach, and understand the theory of action recognition.
